##  **Project Summary – Rainfall Prediction using Regression**

This project aims to predict **district-wise rainfall** using historical rainfall data and statistical features. By applying **regression techniques**, the model learns the relationship between various environmental and regional factors to estimate rainfall levels accurately.

###  **Objective**

To build a predictive model that forecasts rainfall for different districts based on past trends and climatic variables, supporting agricultural planning and water resource management.

###  **Dataset**

The dataset contains district-wise rainfall data, including:

* District and State names
* Monthly rainfall measurements
* Annual average rainfall (Normal)


###  **Workflow**

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning missing values, handling outliers, and formatting data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding rainfall distribution, seasonal variations, and district-wise trends.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Aggregating monthly rainfall into seasonal/annual insights.
4. **Model Building** – Applying regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor).
5. **Model Evaluation** – Comparing performance using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score.
6. **Visualization** – Graphical insights to show rainfall patterns and model results.

###  **Results**

* Identified key rainfall trends across districts.
* Regression models provided accurate rainfall predictions, enabling better insights for climate-based decisions.

###  **Tech Stack**

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

###  **Key Learnings**

* Practical implementation of regression algorithms on real-world climate data.
* Enhanced understanding of feature selection, model evaluation, and EDA techniques.
* Importance of rainfall prediction in supporting agriculture and sustainability.
